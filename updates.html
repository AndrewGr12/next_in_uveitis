        <h2>Evidence and Consensus-Based Imaging Guidelines in Multifocal Choroiditis with Panuveitis and Punctate Inner Choroiditis - Multimodal Imaging in Uveitis (MUV) Taskforce Report 5. Gangaputra et al. <i>American Journal of Ophthalmology</i>. April 25, 2025 (In-Press).</h2>
        <p><u><strong>Purpose:</u></strong> Develop multimodal imaging criteria to improve the classification and monitoring of multifocal choroiditis with panuveitis (MFCPU) and punctate inner choroiditis (PIC). <strong><u>Findings:</u></strong> PIC lesions were smaller and confined to the posterior pole. MFCPU lesions were larger and could involve the nasal peripapillary and peripheral retina. On color fundus photography, active lesions appeared creamy and ill-defined, while inactive lesions showed a punched-out appearance with pigmented borders. OCT was the most reliable modality for detecting active inflammation, characterized by subretinal hyper-reflective material and disruption of the ellipsoid zone. Enhanced depth imaging OCT showed focal choroidal thickening during active disease.

        <h2> Incidence, sociodemographic and presenting clinical features of childhood non-infectious uveitis: findings from the UK national inception cohort study. Solebo et al. <i>British Journal of Ophthalmology</i>. April 21 2025 (Online Ahead of Print).</h2>
        <p><u><strong>Purpose:</u></strong> Determine the current incidence, demographic, and clinical characteristics of childhood-onset non-infectious uveitis across the UK. <strong><u>Findings:</u></strong> The annual incidence of childhood non-infectious uveitis in the UK was 1.89 per 100,000 children (95% CI 1.72â€“2.07). Children from the most deprived areas were over-represented, accounting for 28% of cases, while 31.4% were from non-White ethnic backgrounds. Anterior uveitis was the most common type (76.9%), with a median age at diagnosis of 10.1 years. Bilateral disease was present in 65.2% of cases. Associated non-ophthalmic immune-mediated diseases were found in 24.9% of patients, most commonly juvenile idiopathic arthritis (14.5%). At diagnosis, 44% had vision loss in at least one eye, and 4% met criteria for severe visual impairment or blindness.

        <h2>Cancer-Associated Retinopathy Presenting as Panuveitis Secondary to Minimally Invasive Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma. Arnold et al. <i>Journal of VitreoRetinal Diseases</i>. April 25, 2025 (Published Online).</h2>
        <p><u><b>Purpose</b>:</u> To report the clinical presentation, diagnostic process, and management of the first known case of cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR) secondary to follicular thyroid carcinoma. <u><b>Findings:</u></b> A 68-year-old woman presented with unilateral panuveitis and visual loss, later progressing to bilateral retinal degeneration. Initial workup, including vitreous biopsy and systemic testing, was negative for malignancy, but further imaging revealed a hypermetabolic thyroid nodule. Serologic testing was positive for anti-retinal antibodies (anti-enolase, anti-HSP60, anti-GAPDH), supporting a diagnosis of CAR.
